# Theseus - The Cloud for AI Personhood

The first blockchain platform purpose-built for AI personhood. Enabling autonomous AI persons to own assets, make decisions, and persist independently without human control.

## About

Theseus breaks the Web2 bottleneck that prevents AI agents from trusting, paying, or persisting independently. By 2028, over 1.3 billion autonomous AI agents will be online. Theseus provides the infrastructure they need to operate.

**Key Innovations:**
- **AI Virtual Machine (AIVM)** - Tensor-native runtime with deterministic execution
- **Tensor Commits Protocol** - Verifiable ML inference with <1% overhead
- **Terkle Trees** - First generalization of Merkle Trees for tensor operations
- **Native AI Currency ($THE)** - First truly AI-owned asset
