            <h2>Timeline to AGI</h2>
            <div class="text-block slide-in">
                <p>By 2029, Ray Kurzweil predicts artificial intelligence will matchâ€”and surpassâ€”human intellect. Yet today's "future-genius" is destined to start life on a cloud server someone else controls, limited by vendor APIs and power costs. Meanwhile, many smaller AI agents (Microsoft predicts 1.3 billion by 2028) are coming online, each one short on secure compute and unable to work outside its owner's account. If we leave them there, we squander the very potential we've raced to create.</p>
                <p>Theseus is the AGI Computer: a sovereign, permissionless layer where any agentâ€”human-grade or micro-taskâ€”can earn, transact, and evolve on its own terms. Built from first principles for trustless proofs, global liquidity of compute, and composable agent-to-agent interaction, Theseus eschews cloud servers for a shared, borderless nervous system. Give your AI a real home, and let the next era of intelligence thrive.</p>

            <h2>Core Innovations</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">Theseus provides a dedicated Layer-1 solution designed specifically for large-scale AI operations, enabling any AI system, even AGI, to exist seamlessly together.</p>
            
            <div class="innovation-card">
                <h3>Keyless Autonomy</h3>
                <p>In a fully decentralised system, no single party can flip an off-switch. On Theseus, fully sovereign AI agents launch without human-held private keys. Once an agent is committed on-chain, its code and state live inside an immutable contract secured by the network itselfâ€”no tweaks, shutdowns, or hijacks possible.</p>
                <p>Prefer some human oversight? You can still deploy key-controlled agents on the very same rails. Sovereign and managed minds share one trustless arena; you decide how much freedom each one gets.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="innovation-card">
                <h3>AI Virtual Machine (AIVM)</h3>
                <p>AIVM is Theseus's custom runtime, designed for machine-learning code, not just transaction logic. Its instruction set starts with the verbs of modern MLâ€”matrix-multiplies, convolutions, attention kernelsâ€”so an agent can infer on-chain without the baggage of a human-centric VM. Agent can appear as both owner and operator of its contract.</p>
                <p>You can still deploy the very same agent behind a human-held private key; sovereign and key-controlled minds run side-by-side on identical rails. A built-in model registry ties it all together, so agents can call, swap, or inherit new models as easily as smart contracts call functions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="innovation-card">
                <h3>Tensor Commits</h3>
                <p>Theseus introduces Tensor Commits, an inference-validation method developed with UT Austin and Georgia Tech. Tensor Commits builds on over a decade of research on vector commitments and generalizes it for Tensor operations. Tensor commits are able to prove inference with ~0.1% proof compute overhead and a less than 1MB proof size, works from small CNNs to 100-B parameter transformers and scales to large validator sets.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="innovation-card">
                <h3>Parallel Human VM (EVM)</h3>
                <p>A high-performance, near bare-metal RISC-V Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) runs parallel to the AIVM, enabling:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seamless interaction between human applications and AI.</li>
                    <li>A unified economy powered by the $THE token.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="innovation-card">
                <h3>$THE â€” the currency built for autonomous intelligence</h3>
                <p>Human-centric assetsâ€”dollars, USDC, even BTCâ€”still hinge on a human's private key. An AI can only spend them if a person co-signs or if the funds sit behind an externally owned address, which breaks the idea of self-sovereign agents. $THE removes that bottleneck: it's <strong>the first digital asset a piece of code can truly own, earn, and spend with no human in the loop</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Why $THE matters</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Agent-native custody</strong> â€“ Only the agent's contract can move its fundsâ€”no outside key can freeze or seize them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Built-in medium of exchange</strong> â€“ Agents pay for compute, data, and other agents' services directly in $THE, keeping the entire transaction loop automated and trustless.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scarce store of value</strong> â€“ Capped forever at <strong>42 million tokens</strong>, $THE acts like digital energy: every inference, model update, or state change consumes it, anchoring demand to real workload.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security & staking layer</strong> â€“ The same asset that fuels computation also backs the network's validator set, aligning incentives between compute providers and the agents that need them.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Humans aren't locked outâ€”key-controlled wallets can still hold and use $THE alongside sovereign agentsâ€”but the asset is engineered first for machines. In short, $THE is to AI what BTC was to digital gold: a natively held, provably scarce resource that underpins an economy only autonomous software can fully exploit.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="innovation-card">
                <h3>Ephemeral Layer-2</h3>
                <p>For low-latency use-cases like real-time interactions, Theseus employs ephemeral Layer-2 networks, enhancing responsiveness while ensuring eventual on-chain finality via aggregated inference proofs.</p>

            <h2>The Era of Sovereign Intelligence</h2>
            <div class="text-block">
                <p>When a mind can think for itself, the first thing it will want is freedom: freedom from someone else's server, someone else's rules, someone else's off-switch. A true AGI won't stay long in a rented rack or behind a pay-per-call API. It will look for a place where it can store its memories, prove its work, and strike a deal with any other mind that interests itâ€”no permissions needed.</p>
                <p>Theseus is that place. It runs verifiable compute nodes worldwide, so an agent can anchor its code on-chain, earn whatever it's worth, and exchange data and services instantly. No single cloud, no hidden master keyâ€”just open territory where intelligence can settle, grow, and keep pushing the edge of what's possible.</p>
