Not because you have read it before. Because you had been carrying the thought it names and had not, until that moment, known how to set it down.

The book did not give you the thought. It gave you the words for a thing you already knew. What it changed was the distance between you and the thing.

A friend of mine, a poet, calls this finding your own sentence in another writer's coat pocket. The image is right and slightly wrong. The coat pocket holds a sentence that fits you. But the coat is not yours; the sentence was not yours to begin with. Possession and recognition are different relations to the same words.

I have been thinking about who owns a sentence the reader recognizes. Not the writer who first published it. Not the reader who, hearing it, knew it as theirs.`;

        Owning a Vellum is owning a specific voice. The owner has full

        profile (rhythmic density, lexical register, obsessions, structural
        preferences, closed lexicon) is committed at mint and signed onto
